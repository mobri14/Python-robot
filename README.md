# Python-robot
The main features of the code:
Management of robots:

You can add new bots and delete existing bots.
It is possible to create user accounts for each robot.
Implementation of activities:

Bots can perform various activities, which are implemented here as HTTP requests to APIs.
Activities are queued and robots perform activities in order.
Using multi-threading:

Each bot runs in a separate thread, which means it can perform activities simultaneously without interfering with other activities.
Logging:

Using the logging module, all activities and errors are recorded, which helps in troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
Interaction with the user:

A simple menu is provided to interact with the user, which can easily perform various operations.
Practical applications:
This type of code can be used in various real-world scenarios, such as:

Data Collection Bots: To collect data from various APIs.
Automated services: Bots can act as automated services to perform repetitive tasks on websites and software.
Automated Tests: Can be used as automated test bots to test APIs and collect test data.
Important points:
Security tips: Security tips should be taken into account when using bots, especially in relation to APIs.
Error handling: In real-world situations, more error handling may be required for bots to function properly.
Any misuse of this code is legally the responsibility of the user
